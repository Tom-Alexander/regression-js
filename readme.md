regression.js is a javascript library containing a collection of least squares fitting methods for finding a trend in a set of data. It currently contains methods for linear, exponential, logarithmic, power and polynomial trends.

Usage
=====
Most regressions require only two parameters - the regression method (linear, exponential, logarithmic, power or polynomial) and a data source. A third parameter can be used to define the degree of a polynomial when a polynomial regression is required.
            
regression.js will return an object containing an equation array and a points array.

Linear regression 
-----------------

equation: ```[gradient, y-intercept]``` in the form y = mx + c 
``` 
var data = [[0,1],[32, 67] .... [12, 79]];
var result = regression('linear', data);
``` 
            
Exponential regression 
----------------------

equation: ```[a, b]``` in the form y = ae^bx 
            
Logarithmic regression 
----------------------

equation: ```[a, b]``` in the form y = a + b ln x 
            
Power law regression 
--------------------

equation: ```[a, b]``` in the form y = ax^b 
            
Polynomial regression 
---------------------

equation: ```[a0, .... , an]``` in the form a0x^n ... + anx^0 
```
var data = [[0,1],[32, 67] .... [12, 79]];
var result = regression('polynomial', data, 4);
```
